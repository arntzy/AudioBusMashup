This is the repository for my work-in-progress Mashup which takes the GPS 
bus data for buses in the NYC MTA system, and outputs their locations as
sound. 

To use: Type in the name of a bus line into the text field (e.g."B62"), then hit
one of the arrow buttons to indicate direction. 

HOTKEYS:

'r' -- toggles reference tone on/off

's' -- plays the most recently queried busline/direction as a sequence of
individual notes.
